<h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p> This website is specifically designed for clients looking to renovate their homes regardless of the property type. The first thing that home-owners look about for is the visuals of the projects down by the company. Where the best renovation project designs are showed in the "Designs" page. This will help them to visualise what their homes would look like after renovation.

<h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Feature 1: There is a form for quotation. Home-owners can fill up the form with their digital home floor plan and submit it. So that a free quotation on how much the renovation cost will be will send to the home-owner. It has it's benefits, such as it is free or charge and it saves time to submit online and no in person trip is needed to attain a free quotation.</p>
    <p>Feature 2: There are hover effects to declutter the page. There are hover-over features that will hide the descriptions of the type of design in the "Designs" page. This can help organise and declutter the page as the information will only be visible after hovering the cursor over, as such there will not be too much information at one glance.</p>
